# PowerBi-API
This PBI query written in M language allows you to pull and transform data from external APIs so the data is loaded in neat tables that you can customize with the PowerBi internal tools. First we authorize with service credentials to receive a bearer token that is then used for the endpoints to pull the data. Then we request and expand the data.
